### Contibuting to the i3-Configs RICE Libaray

## Setup
Contibuting to the i3-Configs repo is very straight forward! For those of you wanting to RICE it yourself and send them as a Pull Request, feel free to do the following:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Enter in a terminal, `git clone https://codeberg.org/'user'/i3-Configs`. This should download your version of the repository.
3. Inside said terminal, do `touch [name-of-theme]` in the `Configs` folder, and do `touch [name-of-theme].json` in the `Bumblebee` folder.
4. Use an editor that has support for seeing colors in hexadecimal as you enter them in. I use Neovim 0.9.4 with the NVChad build, but almost any editor with support for seeing hexadecimal-coded colors should work.
5. RICE away!
6. After confirming the RICE is how you want it, send over a Pull Request, and I'll take a look myself, and see how the theme goes. If it's good enough for me, I'll add it in this repository, and credit you however possible.
7. If I see that you've made a theme, and I want to add it, but you didn't make a Pull Request, I'll contact you via email, Matrix Protocol, or Nerimity if you have this info available to inquire about ***possibly*** adding your theme to this repository. If you give me permission to do so, I'll go ahead and add it in.

This is a library of i3 themes that I want to make using the software I already utilize however I can to the best of my abilities and knowledge.
