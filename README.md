# Neigdoig's i3 Configurations
These are the i3 configurations I use whenever I boot up i3 on any Linux operating system, if offered and/or it **works** well with my system. Granted, this is my first time using i3, so those who love using it can let me know however they please how I can improve the rices for it.

## Why I'm doing this
The reason for it is because of a YouTube video that may have had the link to this page already placed in its description. That's for those who wanted to get into i3 in the first place. However, there are some dependencies to be installed. Those are:

1. pcmanfm, the file manager I use for i3
2. autotiling, so you can use i3 as a dynamic tiler
3. bumblebee-status, the bar I personally use for i3 as a drop-in replacement for i3status
5. Iosevka fonts, a beautiful font family that's very popular

## How to install it
In order to install it, just do
`git clone https://codeberg.org/Neigdoig/i3-Configs.git`

Next, do `cp path/to/i3-Configs/Configs/name-of-config ~/.config/i3/config`

After that, do `cp /path/to/i3-Configs/Bumblebee/name-of-config.json /path/to/bumblebee/status/themes/name-of-config.json` to add the corresponding Bumblebee Status theme.

After all of that, the i3 rices are available for you to use. Enjoy!
